# Multi-Threaded TCP Server

## Overview

The Multi-Threaded TCP Server is a versatile C application that showcases network programming and multi-threading skills. It's a valuable addition to your software engineering portfolio, demonstrating your ability to develop concurrent server applications.

## Key Features

### Concurrent Server

- The server can handle multiple client connections concurrently, optimizing resource utilization.
- Each client connection runs in a separate thread, enabling simultaneous communication.

### Network Communication

- Listens on a specified port for incoming TCP connections from clients.
- Receives and processes client data, responding with bidirectional network communication.

### Robust Error Handling

- Incorporates robust error-handling mechanisms to gracefully manage issues like socket creation failures, client connection errors, and thread creation problems.
- Error messages provide clear feedback for debugging and troubleshooting.

### Scalability

- Designed with scalability in mind, making it suitable for applications requiring numerous concurrent clients.
- Potential for extending features or integrating into complex systems.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Code**: Compile the C source code using a C compiler such as `gcc`:

  `gcc multi_threaded_tcp_server.c -o multi_threaded_tcp_server -lpthread`

2. **Run the Server**: Execute the compiled server program:
  
  `./multi_threaded_tcp_server`
  
3. **Connect Clients**: Clients can connect to the server by specifying the server's IP address and the port number specified in the code (default is 8080).

4. **Interact with Clients**: Clients can send and receive messages to and from the server.


3. **Follow On-Screen Prompts**: The system will guide you through file version management, comparison, and merging operations. Follow the prompts for each task.

## Future Enhancements

This project offers a foundation for developing more sophisticated server applications. Consider the following enhancements:

- **Security Measures**: Implement authentication and encryption to secure client-server communication.
- **Protocol Extensions**: Extend the server to support custom communication protocols for specific applications.
- **Load Balancing**: Explore load balancing strategies for distributing client connections across multiple server instances.
